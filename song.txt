Near the Poplars

Gold meadows
Lead up to the sky
And sadness is all around
Poplar, poplar, leaned over
There, old fathers5
Wept as they stood.
Farewell to their son
As he became a hero
Young lad,
young Cossack.

There near poplars, the kalyna* grows
Mothers eyes wait for you.
She is crying in despair
Still waiting for her son
But God already has his soul.
Mother, I died for freedom,
For truth and the destiny of future generations.17
For those who are far away in the sea
And they will return alive on the stork's wings.

Quietly outside
And only listening as,
As his mother's words
Flew, flew towards the Cossack.
"You see my son
The candle hasn't gone out25
Forever she will yet burn
She will burn.
Young lad,
young Cossack."

There near poplars, the kalyna* grows
Mothers eyes wait for you.
She is crying in despair
Still waiting for her son33
But God already has his soul.
Mother, I died for freedom,
For truth and the destiny of future generations.
For those who are far away in the sea
And they will return alive on the stork's wings

A year had already passed
A new spring came
But there was no peace of mind,
There was none already and still there is none.
There the tired father
Alone paved the way44
For the son to follow it himself
And yet he did not.
Young lad,
Young Cossack.
